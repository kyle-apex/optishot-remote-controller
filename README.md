### Credit

Appreciate this application? This app is free, but it was started based off of the [electron react typescript webpack boiler plate](https://github.com/Devtography/electron-react-typescript-webpack-boilerplate#readme) by Wing Chau ([@iamWing](https://github.com/iamWing)), so if you'd like to support it in some way please consider supporting at [@iamWing](https://github.com/sponsors/iamWing).

Otherwise, consider a donation to my favorite charity here in Austin, TX: [TreeFolks](https://treefolks.org)
